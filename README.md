Crime in Chicago
I don’t think I have what we would describe as a traditional beat, but I’ve mostly written and edited pieces about African American lives and their intersections with racism, feminism, sexism and music.

As it relates to the aforementioned, I’ve become really interested in crime in Chicago, and the lack of understanding we have around the issue. Since the shooting death of Chicago's 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton at the beginning of 2013, the city's high murder rate - and its very young victims, most of whom are brown -- received some long overdue national attention. I’d call it hysteria. 

Gang conflict seemed to be at the center of all the violence, but a two-part series on This American Life about violence in the Chi revealed something confounding: Kids don't intentionally join gangs in Chicago. Instead, teens are assigned to cliques based on a bunch of arbitrary factors that are often out of their control, like where they live or what school they attend. I found this super interesting. 

So my curiosity around this caused me to ask two questions: How can we get a more accurate profile of what those involved in violent crime in the Chi look like? Also, how screwed up is the national reporting on this issue? 

There is tons of data around crime in Chicago, lots of which supports the idea that when compared to other cities, Chicago is not the most murderous city in the country despite what headlines would have us to believe. Because of the cities large population and because the violent areas are really segregated, the likelihood of getting murdered in Chicago is much lower than, say, Detroit. The FBI’s 2012 crime stats report supports this. The Chicago Police Department also offers some stats on how they classify murders, but the latest report was done in 2011.

I couldn’t find any data that had more information about the interior lives of the murder victims AND the perpetrators. Were they officially apart of a gang?  Are the victims gang members in what we would call the traditional sense? Are the perpetrators? And further, when a “gang member” in Chicago is murdered, does it even mean that that death was gang related?

Homicide Watch Chicago is a resource I’d love to mine to get some of this information, since they follow stories and ask pertinent questions about the interior lives of the perpetrators and the victims. How many of the murders that the CPD deemed “gang related” fit into the traditional gang narrative? How many do not? 

In regard to reporting, I’d like to look through a database like Lexus Nexus and look at the reporting on crime in Chicago in 2013, and count how many national news stories got it wrong when they classified a Chicago murder as “gang related”.
